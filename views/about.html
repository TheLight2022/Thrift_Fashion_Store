                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Our story started with a problem (the best ideas usually do). Some ten years ago, our founder, Jenny Johnson, was furnishing her flat, while she realized the lack of affordable and quality furniture pieces available in the market. So she set out to collaborate with independent designers and makers to create pieces you’ll love, minus the mark-up.</p>
                    <p>In 2010, Jenny got a chance to visit renowned chair manufacturers, Bergen and Bel Air. Surprised by the top-notch quality of their designs, along with the approach they took to protect the environment, she set out to team with them.</p>
                    <p>Yet, they all knew that they lacked something: an organization that suits every taste and need of customers. That was when Bartlett came in with the versatility of a new brand in the industry, the last piece of the puzzle that they all needed. And so Thrift Fashion Store was born. The destination for creating your dream home.</p>

                    <p>We’re taking positive steps to reduce our impact on the planet. For us, that means retailing responsibly. We’ve set a number of goals to get us there.</p>
                    <p>Our commitment to great design has extended into making better business choices that minimise our impact on people and the planet. For 2021, we’re focusing on four key areas where we can really make a difference. This is just the start of our journey, so keep checking back for updates.</p>
                    <p>The way we see it, sustainability begins with responsible sourcing. From making sure our key materials create less environmental impact, through to selecting suppliers aligned with our core values. It’s not simply our business strategy, but our moral obligation.</p>
                    <p>Things like: eliminating all unnecessary plastic from our product packaging, and ensuring that the most environmentally impactful materials we use are 100% sustainably sourced.</p>
