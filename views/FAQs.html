                                <p>Yes, we never store your full card details, only a token (that we use for future purchases) and enough information to display on the website so that you know which card it is, i.e. the last 4 digits of the card number. Also, we only allow the card to be used when the same delivery address has been used for the card before, which reduces the risk of someone accessing your Thrift Fashion account and ordering with your saved card.</p>
