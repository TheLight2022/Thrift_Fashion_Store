I noticed on the label that the Cedarwood Plaid shirt was made in India, while the Shale Plaid shirt was made in China. After one wash/dry cycle following the directions on the label, I found that the Cedarwood Plaid's fabric had pilled much more than the Shale Plaid shirt had after multiple washings. Another thing I noticed is that the backside reinforcement stitching for the top corners of the shirt pocket on the Cedarwood Plaid shirt was done using small pieces of scrap fabric that were already unraveling. Just seemed like a very messy and low quality way of doing it. The same backside stitching on the Shale Plaid shirt was done much more neatly and looks strong.",

I think the issue is that the material is too thin - it's just see through and not strong enough to actually shape you at all. I returned.",

Not too long but past the rear, the back is a little higher so your bra wont show but still at a flattering length and the straps are wide. I will definately be adding more tank tops from this collection in other colors.",

I didn't read the description closely obviously but the material is nice; I assumed they were just cotton but it's the same material and feeling as those 32 degree shirts if you're familiar with those. And those are much more expensive. The neck is a little wider then your average cotton t shirt so it looks a bit more stylish. The only reason I knocked a star off is because the seam on the one shoulder where the sleeve attaches is kind of 'bubbled' for lack of a better term. But it's hardly noticeable - in fact I had a hard time capturing it in a picture! I will definitely be buying these again!I bought a Large and it fits just the way I want it too - loosely and long.
