I noticed on the label that the Cedarwood Plaid shirt was made in India, while the Shale Plaid shirt was made in China. After one wash/dry cycle following the directions on the label, I found that the Cedarwood Plaid's fabric had pilled much more than the Shale Plaid shirt had after multiple washings. Another thing I noticed is that the backside reinforcement stitching for the top corners of the shirt pocket on the Cedarwood Plaid shirt was done using small pieces of scrap fabric that were already unraveling. Just seemed like a very messy and low quality way of doing it. The same backside stitching on the Shale Plaid shirt was done much more neatly and looks strong.",

I can fit a small or medium if I want my tops loose so with these reviews I went with a medium. The fit is perfect. Not too long but past the rear, the back is a little higher so your bra wont show but still at a flattering length and the straps are wide. I will definately be adding more tank tops from this collection in other colors.",

I didn't read the description closely obviously but the material is nice; I assumed they were just cotton but it's the same material and feeling as those 32 degree shirts if you're familiar with those. And those are much more expensive. The neck is a little wider then your average cotton t shirt so it looks a bit more stylish. The only reason I knocked a star off is because the seam on the one shoulder where the sleeve attaches is kind of 'bubbled' for lack of a better term. But it's hardly noticeable - in fact I had a hard time capturing it in a picture! I will definitely be buying these again!I bought a Large and it fits just the way I want it too - loosely and long.

The pockets are deep, you can definitely fit whatever you possibly need inside of them. The drawstrings are a bit too big, there’s quite the load of slack even when the waist is stretched out. The logos and fabric are pretty average in quality, but they hold up very well. My favorite part about these shorts definitely Hass to be the metal tips on the strings, at the base of the drawstrings, and the zippers. Other than that, these shorts fit well. They right above the knee and when stretching your legs, they come about halfway up the quads. If you don’t like high riding shorts when sitting down, definitely don’t buy these. In terms of sizing, the shorts are definitely fit true to size. The only complaint I have with these shorts is that the crotch area is a little on the less-roomy side. Besides that, they’re a great pair of shorts.",

Even in the heat, my head stayed cool enough not to distract me from pushing on! Fits well too! I have long hair and was able to pull it all back into a ponytail thru the back-adjustable strap area with ease. A great addition to the multitude of head gear I use.",

My only issue is that this item will be packeted and sent out in regular bag. Mine came with a huge crease and opted to take a discount and steamed the damage out as best as possible. Hope they go back to making them like how they use to be. Ordering hats online is such a hit or miss experience.",
